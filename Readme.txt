In this Project, an experimental evaluation of linear regression on the
Athens houses dataset is done and on an artificial dataset with and without L2 regularization. 

The input data is available with in this repositary 

1. [Univariate Linear Regression]



2. [Multivariate linear Regression]



3. [Polynomial Curve Fitting]

 an experimental evaluation of a linear regression is run 
 with and without regularization Using the normal equations 


Consider a linear regression model with polynomial basis functions, trained with
the objective shown below:



Train and evaluate the linear regression model in the following scenarios:
1. Without regularization:
2. With regularization:
